# üèõÔ∏è Cloture Backend

This is the backend for the Cloture application.

This [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) server performs two functions:

1. Accepts traffic from NGINX and routes to the correct port
2. Fetches data from the `MongoDB` database upon receiving GQL requests from the frontend.

## Installation

`npm install`

_or_

`yarn install`

## Environment and Development

Create two environment files and store them in the root of this folder. The required development file `.env.development`

```
# Must match the port provided through the REACT_APP_API in frontend
PORT=[number]
# Presumably something like mongodb://localhost:27017/cloture
MONGODB_URI=[string]
MONGODB_USER=?[string]
MONGODB_PASS=?[string]
```

Once the variables are configured, run `yarn dev:start`

## Sample Data

The should be populated in two MongoDB collections titled `houseCommittees` and `senateCommittees` which you can download [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloture/dump.tar.gz).

You can then run [mongorestore](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongoimport/) on the `dump` folder to import it into your local/cloud DB.

## Structure

The project uses Type-GraphQL and Apollo.

Apollo is a state management library for JavaScript and Typescript, and we're using the express variant‚Äîwhich lets us also serve up our frontend.

We're using [Type-GraphQL](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql) to build the schemas and resolvers for our Apollo server. The library lets us dynamically generate our schemas and resolvers by creating types and decorators. We're using [Typegoose](https://github.com/typegoose/typegoose) (similar to `Type-GraphQL`) to generate our resolver functions.
